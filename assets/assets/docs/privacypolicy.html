        <p>Privacy Policy | Effective from August 27, 2023 Sunday</p>

        <h3>Introduction to the platform</h3>
        <p>Academy Platforms is a school management software developed by Shivam Yadav. This platform is designed to
            streamline various school administrative tasks and enhance communication between school staff, students, and
            parents. As this platform offers numerous benefits, it is equally committed to safeguarding the privacy and
            security of all users. By familiarizing yourself with this privacy policy, you will gain a comprehensive
            understanding of how this platform operates.</p>

        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
        <p>Similar to interactions within an educational environment, Academy Platforms only requires relevant
            information to ensure smooth functioning. The following information is collected by the platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account Information: Name, class, section, role (student, teacher, parent, etc.) and other basic
                information are collected to establish unique user accounts. The information helps with identification
                whereas they are optional. This data remains accessible only to administrative personnel and is not
                shared with external parties. Any API keys used within the platform do not contain personal information.
                School administration retains the option to delete their accounts at any time.</li>
            <li>Activity Tracking: The platform logs events, such as user actions, system crashes, and performance
                metrics. This data is anonymous and does not include specific messages or interactions. These logs aid
                in improving platform functionality and ensuring effective service delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Use of Collected Information</h3>
        <p>Academy Platforms is dedicated to upholding user privacy and utilizing collected information solely for
            appropriate purposes. The platform employs user information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provision and Enhancement of Services: As outlined in the 'Collection of Information' section, the
                platform collects relevant data to offer improved user experiences and access to its services.</li>
            <li>Legal Compliance: In adherence to legal obligations, user information may be used as required by law,
                such as responding to legal processes like subpoenas.</li>
            <li>Performance Analysis: The information gathered assists in analyzing platform progress, identifying areas
                for improvement, and enhancing response times. No data beyond what is mentioned in the 'Collection of
                Information' section is utilized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
        <p>Academy Platforms does not trade, rent, or disclose user information to third parties. Analytical insights
            are generated using tools such as Google Analytics, while crash reports and performance metrics are managed
            through Firebase Crashlytics and Performance tools. However, the platform reserves the right to share user
            information if compelled by the laws of the user's country. Such sharing only occurs in cases where
            suspicion of illegal activities arises, as determined by the local court.</p>

        <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
        <p>Safeguarding user data is paramount for Academy Platforms. Rigorous security measures, including encryption,
            firewalls, and secure servers, are employed. Data security aligns with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service’s
            security protocols. While absolute security cannot be guaranteed online, rest assured that the platform does
            not possess information that could pose harm to users.</p>

        <h3>Services for Minors</h3>
        <p>Academy Platforms caters to users of all ages, including minors. However, it never provides content that is
            not suitable for children. Parents and guardians are urged to monitor their child's usage of this platform,
            as well as other digital services. Various messaging and communication tools are needed to be frequently
            monitored by the guardians. For best security, Academy recommends less data to be shared within the app for
            your children under age 13 like you have the option not to provide “blood group” information until needed by
            the administrator.</p>

        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Adapting to evolving circumstances, Academy Platforms may introduce or remove features, adjust operations, or
            align with changing laws. Consequently, this privacy policy is subject to updates that will be communicated
            via email and push notifications. Continued use of the platform post-policy changes indicates acceptance of
            these modifications.</p>
